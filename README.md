# âš¡ Spark

This project focuses on understanding and developing a **PageRank algorithm** using **PySpark**. The final code was implemented and executed within the **Databricks** environment.

- **PageRank Algorithm**: A ranking algorithm originally used by Google to rank web pages, implemented here using PySpark for distributed computation.
- **Testing with Wikipedia**: While the code was designed to work with the entire **Wikipedia** database, we were unable to run it ourselves due to computational limitations.
- **Challenges Faced**: We encountered several challenges throughout the development process, which are thoroughly documented and explained in the project.

This project showcases the application of **distributed computing** and large-scale data processing.
